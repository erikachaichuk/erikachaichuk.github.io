                    <p>The real estate market is a complex and dynamic entity of a huge interest for investors and policymakers. 
                            Analyzing the real estate market is essential due to several reasons. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Firstly,</span> it promotes informed decision making. 
                            Such analysis provides with profitable investment opportunities and evaluates potential returns on properties for investors, 
                            as well as helps buyers to understand property prices, trends, and affordability before purchasing housing. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Secondly,</span> tracking trends on real estate market gives insights into whether the market is appreciating or depreciating, 
                            while analyzing how many properties are available versus sold on the market aids with identifying market imbalances. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The aim of this project is to conduct an analysis of the real estate market by leveraging data visualization techniques using Python programming language. </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>Specifically, this project focuses on: <br>
                        1. <span style="color: #ff8177;">Deal Satisfaction:</span> comparison of deal satisfaction by country on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 strongly dissatisfied, while 5 – strongly satisfied. </p>
                        <br>
                        2.	<span style="color: #ff8177;">Demographic Insights:</span> examination of age distribution within the market to understand the demographic composition of clients and its implications for the market targeting and segmentation. </p>
                        <br>
                        3.	<span style="color: #ff8177;">US Clientele Segmentation:</span> analysis of the geographical distribution of real estate clients in US, segmented by state, to identify state-level trends and opportunities. </p>
                        <br>
                        4.	<span style="color: #ff8177;">Revenue Trends:</span> assessment of the total revenues of the real estate market from 2004 to 2010 inclusive to understand the overall market growth.</p>
                        <br>
                        5.	<span style="color: #ff8177;">Sale Analysis by Building Type:</span> track and visualization of the total number of sales per year by building type to reveal the demand patterns and preferences in property types. </p>
                        </p>

                    <p>This project utilizes data from Kaggle. The corresponding csv files can be found on 
                        <a href="https://www.github.com/erikachaichuk" style="color: #ff8177; text-decoration: underline;">Github</a>. </p> 
                    <br>
                    <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Firsty,</span>  the properties data set was cleaned. The ID column was converted to string type to avoid unintentional numeric operations on the ID series. 
                        The column was also renamed to discard the irrelevant metadata. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Second,</span>  the customers data set was cleaned. There was an encoding issue with the ID column in the “properties”, and the first column in the “customers_raw_data” was also compromised. 
                        The column was thus renamed. Next, the entity column was turned from categoric to numeric by being renamed to ”individual” with values being mapped to 0 and 1. The “mortgage” variable was mapped to 0 and 1 as well. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Third,</span>  the two datasets were combined. That was possible through the “customer_ID” being the same feature in both tables. 
                        The initial merge resulted in missing some customer data because IDs in the “properties” table were flanked with empty spaces. </p>
                        <br>
                        To overcome this problem, .strip() method was used, which removed the unnecessary spaces in both tables “customer_ID” series. 
                        The second attempt was successful, hence the joint table named “real estate data” was created. Before processing further, the data types of the combined table were verified.
                        </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> The <span style="color: #ff8177;">analysis phase</span>  began with calculating the age at purchase by taking it from the “birth_date” and “date_of_sale” fields. </p>
                        <br>
                        Descriptive statistics and interval-based age groupings provided insights into the customers demographics. 
                        Property prices were similarly analyzed by grouping them into price intervals, getting the distribution of the sold and unsold properties. </p>
                        <br>
                        To examine therelationship between <span style="color: #ff8177;">age and property prices</span>,  covariance and correlation was utilized. 
                        The covariance revealed the extent of the relationship and whether the age impacts the price of properties. The correlation coefficient helped to explore the relationship further. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><span style="color: #ff8177;">Geographical and categorical insights</span>  were explored through breakdowns. 
                        For example, the properties were analyzed by building to see the trends in average price, area, and deal satisfaction. 
                        A state-level breakdown included frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative frequency calculations.
